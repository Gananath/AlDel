For deleting malicious files from removable disks and pendrives in windows

#IMPORTANT
While pushing the batch file to github; git breaks the code. Its some thing to do with pusing my orginal batch file format **ISO-8859-1 to UTF8 auto conversion** inside github. Currently I dont have any solution for this problem. I have added an executable version of my batch file to the repo and you can reverse engineer the batch file from this exe.

#What is it?
This is a batch file I created more than seven years ago to delete malicious files from my windows XP/7 machine. I now have moved away from Windows to Linux and this was lying there in one of the folders.Its main purpose was to delete malicious files from XP machine, re-enable gadgets like *Reedit*,*CMD* and *Task Manager* which were disabled by those viruses or trogens and unhide *hidden* folders or files. 

#Who should use it?
- For some one who is interested in programming and likes to tinker with codes

#What I dont gurantee?
- I used this for **my** personal use and not sure whether it will work for others.
- **Strictly** made for programmers who have a basic understanding of programming
- Not sure about its compactibility with later windows OS.
- I have hard coded to prevent users entering windows system drive letter but still advice to exercise a little caution
