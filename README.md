For deleting malicious files in windows

#What is it?
This is a batch file I created more than seven years ago to delete malicious files from my windows XP/7 machine. I now have moved away from Windows to Linux and this was lying there in one of the folders.Its main purpose was to delete malicious files from XP machine, re-enable gadgets like *Reedit*,*CMD* and *Task Manager* which were disabled by those viruses or trogens and unhide *hidden* folders or files. 

#Who should use it?
For some one who is interested in programming and likes to tinker with codes

#What I dont gurantee?
I used this for **my** personal use and not sure whether it will work for others.
**Strictly** made for programmers who have a basic understanding of programming
Not sure about its compactibility with later windows OS.
