# AlDel
For deleting malicious files from removable disks and pendrives in windows

# IMPORTANT
Due to some compactibility issue with git I have to rename the batch file. You can either use **Aldel.bat.txt** or **Aldel.bat.zip** file and rename and remove the last **.txt** or **.zip**
# What is it?
This is a batch file I created more than seven years ago to delete malicious files from my windows XP/7 machine. I now have moved away from Windows to Linux and this was lieing there in one of the folders.Its main purpose was to delete malicious files from XP machine, re-enable gadgets like *Regedit*,*CMD* and *Task Manager* which were disabled by those viruses or trogens and unhide *hidden* folders or files. 

# Who should use it?
- For some one who is interested in programming and likes to tinker with codes

# What I dont gurantee?
- I used this for **my** personal use and not sure whether it will work for others.
- **Strictly** made for programmers who have a basic understanding of programming
- Not sure about its compactibility with later windows OS.
- I have hard coded to prevent users entering windows system drive letter but still advice to exercise a little caution
